ðŸ”Ž @loaderkit/resolve - General purpose nodejs module resolver
==============================================================

An accurate & abstract implementation of the nodejs module resolution algorithms. It implements both
the [CommonJS](https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#all-together) and
[modules](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#resolution-and-loading-algorithm) algorithms. Originally
authored for [arethetypeswrong](https://arethetypeswrong.github.io).

See also: [resolve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/resolve),
[enhanced-resolve](https://github.com/webpack/enhanced-resolve), and
[esm-resolve](https://www.npmjs.com/package/esm-resolve). The main point of this package is accuracy
with the default nodejs resolution algorithms.

- **Does nothing that the nodejs default resolver doesn't do**
- Runs in a web browser w/ abstract filesystems
- Sensible TypeScript-first types
- Shakeable ESM exports
- Promise & synchronous implementations
